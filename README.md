# site-delta

### MakeAvoy

Original vanilla site converter to typescript and webpack5

### Petrichor

Svelte site includes markdown and builtin command based search bar activated by typing any text anywhere on the page. On mobile use the magnifying glass button

### Backend

rust built axum and tower based server replaces old Node.js runtime for original site, socket integrations coming soon

# DEVELOPMENT (WIP)

run http-server -a 0.0.0.0 -p 9001 within makeavoy-assets and then `npm run watch` for makeavoy-package so it points to the served asset proxy
