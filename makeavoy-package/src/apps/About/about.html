          <h2>ConnectReport</h2>
          <p>
            ConnectReport is the largest scaled application I've worked on.
            Brought on as a product engineer, I quickly worked with the entire
            scope of the project, including backend and frontend. I built a
            freeform grid system, cell snapping and table alignment in the
            absence of a true sheets-mode. I oversaw a gradual conversion of old
            ES 2015 code into modern typescript webpack application. The
            majority of the product code was undocumented so I undertook the
            task of documenting everything in sight. SOme swathes of code were
            rewritten just to support intellisense due to the reliance of
            AngularJS. In addition to devops tasks to correct CI issues, I also
            created a series of web components to work with other data platforms
            like QlikSense, Big Query, Databricks, Snowflake, etc.

          <h2>Petrichor64</h2>
          <p>
            An ambitious project intended to create a retro game engine/fantasy
            console like the 5th generation of game consoles. Back when 3D was
            fresh and polygonal and sound synthesis was cheap and limited. The
            constraints similar to fantasy consoles like PICO-8 or TIC-80 offer
            developers restricted sandbox environment which forces creative
            solutions to implement desired game projects. Although not as
            limited due to using a full 3D renderer built using the
            <a href="https://wgpu.rs/">WGPU</a> graphics API, the goal is for
            the Lua scripting layer to allow anyone to quickly make interesting
            3D games and applications that run anywhere
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition to cross platform and music synthesis, the system
            features easy asset loading, 3D tiling system that doubles as a 2D
            system if desired, fast drawing rasters that can be used as textures
            for sprites or 3d models. Models can be built inline via the mod
            command, or loaded in as gltf/glb files. The full CLI in-engine
            allows quick building, loading, and bundling game projects
          </p>
          <p>
            This project is ongoing since early 2019 and has many features still
            in the work. Currently a lua interpreter is being built from scratch
            so as to allow for compiling to wasm32-unknown-unknown targets, and
            this make the engine web-compatible

          <h2>Makeavoy</h2>
          <p>
            This site, Makeavoy.com, utilizes all of my favorite techniques I've
            picked up over the years. It's a little experimental as it's
            exploring what's possible for a single page application, so don't be
            surprised if the source is a little bit sloppy! There's a lot going
            on under the hood so I'm going to break it down here...
          </p>
          <h2>Backend</h2>
          <p>
            Originally using node.js with vhost in express.js to allow multiple
            domains on the same server, it's since been moved over to a rust
            built axum/tower server that serves either MakeAvoy.com or
            Petrichor64.app depending on the hostname provided. Socket.io was
            originally used for WebSockets and currently a rust alternative is
            WIP. There's also MariaDB and SQLite3 databases for testing user
            authentication. After that, various projects are separated by
            folders and sub modules to keep things organized. It's all rolled
            out on my locally hosted Ubuntu server.
          </p>
          <h2>FrontEnd</h2>
          <p>
            The main site utilizes a lot of 3D via Three.js. Due to the above
            average script sizes, everything is lazy loaded on demand in order
            to reduce the Time to Interaction. The Rendering system is triggered
            to load at runtime, while each additional "app" is loaded upon
            clicking so as to only load the necessary content, at the cost of
            some load time. The initial payload hosts the basics such as the 3D
            CSS loading animation, and the app navigation system. The site loads
            in a self made SVG title that 'draws' into place by a
            stroke-dashoffset. It also includes dynamic app button movement and
            placement a la an iPad, and a snazzy vector based drawing system to
            animate the navigation bar using perpendicular velocity offsets. The
            title accommodates for the bar as well. Finally, each app when
            loaded in applies to Canvas3D the scene contents and animation
            cycles. Upon swapping apps, the buffer is dumped to an image raster
            and stealthily swapped in. This was done for an old Three.js
            limitation but is no longer necessary.All 3D and SVG assets are my
            own.
          </p>
          <p>
            Site was originally pure vanilla JS, You can view this
            <a href="https://github.com/Auxnon/NewWave">here</a> but was
            recently converted to a typescript and webpack 5 setup for better

          <p>
            A Svelte built site utilizing markdown dumped from an automated
            build process on every release of Petrichor64. Markdown is left
            inline under command implementations via rust macros and composited
            into a single file and uploaded to server. Site also utilizes a
            command tag based search bar upon typing or using the search button
            on mobile.

        <h2>Social Game - experimental online board game</h2>
        <p>
          This was an extremely ambitious project. As mentioned before, the
          server hosts an instance of Cannon.js that keeps synced up with local
          user instances of Cannon.js in order to replicate a multiplayer
          physics sandbox experience on a hexagonal grid game platform. The
          current results are less then ideal as the updates are not constant in
          order to not strain the server. But aside the occasional physics
          artifacts it has the ability to 'store' 3D items into the DOM, send
          messages including 16x16 images, modify the terrain on the fly, and
          user authentication and administration. There was also a D&D character
          sheet implemented that saves into a sqlite3 database. Everything is
          very WIP. An "infinite" terrain system is in the works, as well as
          height maps, inverse kinematics animation systems, better
          environmental GLSL effects, and waypointing. Like i said, extremely
          ambitious. But I'm super happy with it so far!

          <h2>Desk.js - User Interface</h2>
          <p>
            This experimental interface is intended for touchscreen. Created as
            means to test the possibility of managing multiple window or objects
            with separate hands and fingers, It registers all of 10 fingers
            separately. You can drag an item with one finger while moving
            another item with a separate finger, or resize one item with one
            hand while moving or expanding another interdependently. When items
            overlap, they can be moved together just like you could with a stack
            of papers (toggleable logic). You can also drag an image file to it
            from the desktop to paste in images, or double tap a square to paste
            text. Context menu (long press or right click) the desktop brings up
            a radial menu. The entire project is a bit rough and really needs an
            update to iron out the bugs, including some lag only on iOS.

          <h2>Fruit App</h2>
          <p>
            This was a recent attempt to achieve a "Pixel Perfect" web
            application. It's based on dribble artist
            <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/6798936-Food-fruits"
              >Caroline's</a
            >
            design. It's not perfect obviously, especially without knowing exact
            measurements. It's mobile first, so desktop looks a little bit
            silly, but it's fully responsive. Pulled some slightly
            <a href="https://material.io/resources/icons/"
              >Material Design icons</a
            >
            plus my own, and added some nifty animations for transitions. This
            is my first official use of SCSS, using just sublime build system
            rather then WebPack. Due to the small scope, housed the JS in the
            HTML file.

          <h2>Reserver</h2>
          <p>
            This was another simple
            <abbr title="Progressive Web App">PWA</abbr> that evolved for work
            necessity. 12 members of our team were forced to use a single citrix
            portal in order to management client incidents. Anytime someone used
            it, if someone else was working with it already, they would get
            kicked out. We did our best to alert each other but sometimes we
            would miss messages. I created this app as a stopgap. It's a simple
            neomrophic button with gradient background opacity animations (since
            we still can't tween background gradients...) that sends a socket.io
            WebsScket message to the server reserving your status and alerting
            all connected clients of the state change. Non occupying clients can
            then "pend" the user sending them desktop notifications (if they
            opted in) and even posting in our discord chat via webhooks that
            they were waiting. Full
            <abbr title="Progressive Web App">PWA</abbr> manifest and desktop
            icons included for pinning to the taskbar!

          <h2>SVG Editor</h2>
          <p>
            This was an earlier project to make my own online SVG editor.
            There's some decent ones out there but nothing quite met my
            requirements. Also wanted to take a stab at a decent touch screen
            ready editor, which there are even fewer out their in my experience.
            Highly experimental so a lot of the functionality needs reworked,
            such as my newer color wheel system also pictured. Also the point
            editor creates clickable DOM elements which is too much pollution
            for a larger shape for now. It does accommodate for alignment
            snapping vertically and horizontally, eventually right angles as
            well. Very happy with how the animations and effects came out so I
            will definitely be working on this again in the near future!

          <p>
            Stompadon was my first ever web project over 10 years ago. I had
            made a number of flash games back in the day, but even then Flash
            was clearly dying. A friend wanted help supporting a kickstarter for
            a plush of a character she had designed. Since I knew flash was a no
            go, the next closest thing was HTML5, and the rest is history. The
            code is very rough, poorly defined variables and this was before I
            understood functions very well (pre-ECMA6 after all). Even still, it
            continues to run to this day and is still one of my favorites!

            A little angular project for a unique music player design. The the
            tracker bar is a live waveform visualizer. it's somewhat artificial
            as it animates with various degrees of seveirty based on on current
            sound bytes amplitude. Eventually I'll just render the actual
            waveform properly. The data is all there it just needs the correct
            math. I would also like to add more music options and maybe make it
            a dedicate music player (Spotify API? Desktop Electron app? Who
            knows!)

            Get is a simple file server hosted on the same site. It supports

            that safely takes care of the file storage. It's not the cleanest
            system and it's certainly not available to public yet until I can
            properly secure everything.

            This project was a bit sloppy, but it was a necessary step in order
            to organize my tech support job. There were some existing options
            out there but nothing quote met my needs, so I made it instead. It's
            effectively an advanced bookmark manager, with note taking, and
            ideally password management. What started as a joke became crucial
            for organizing my workflow, as we supported over 40 unique clients'
            stacks and a couple hundred sub clients. As I couldn't safely store
            passwords, this aspect got scraped as I was unable to meet the job's
            encryption requirements at the time. As all clients can be added in
            manually and stored as a JSON object through localstorage, it was
            infinitely customizable and exportable. It stored unique notes for
            each client as well, and even stored background color preferences.
            There was a break system being incorporated via socket.io but
            ultimately fell to the wayside as well. I hope to clean up this
            logic for some sort of organizational app someday.

          <h2>Interval</h2>
          <p>
            This ancient project really dates me. This is the best picture I
            could find. I attempted to make a kickstarter almost a decade ago
            for a Java game i had been working on. Needless to say it failed due
            to a variety of reasons. 1. The project scope was too ambitious,
            tying into a massive timeline array system. It worked but there was
            no way to make enough content to fit such a system. Also the fact it
            was build on LWJGL java library was pretty nuts since Java games
            never worked well (even Minecraft had massive performance issues).
          </p>

          <p>
            Even still I'd love to return to it someday. Due to it's reliance on
            Java it'd need to be ported to something much better. I've also
            learned so much about UI since then I'll have to rewrite most of it.
